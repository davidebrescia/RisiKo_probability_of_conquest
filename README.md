# RISIKO Probability Calculator

Just to make my friends hate me even more :)

## Problem
We're talking about the RisiKo game (a.k.a. 'Risk'). I have N armies in Kamchatka. My opponent has M armies in Alaska. If I attack, what's the probability of conquering the Alaska?  

## How
I do many simulations of the battle. Probability = Number of winning battles / Total number of battles.

## Fun facts
- 100 vs 50 it's a suicide for the attacker (3.2% of conquest)
- N vs N it's a suicide for the attacker from N = 2:  
2 vs 2: 10.7%  
3 vs 3: 10.0%  
4 vs 4: 8.6%  
5 vs 5: 6.5%
