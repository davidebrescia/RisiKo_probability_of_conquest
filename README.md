# RISIKO Probability Calculator

Just to make my friends hate me even more :)

## Problem
RisiKo game (a.k.a. 'Risk'). I have N armies in Kamchatka. My opponent has M armies in Alaska. If I attack, what's the probability of conquering the Alaska?  

## How
Many simulations of the entire battle.

## Fun facts
- 100 vs 50 it's a suicide for the attacker (3.2% of conquest)
- N vs N it's a suicide for the attacker from N = 2:  
2vs2: 10.7%  
3vs3: 10.0%  
4vs4: 8.6%  
5vs5: 6.5%
